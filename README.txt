The program can be executing via opening the 'Project1_stater.py' file. Doing so will take the inputs from input.txt and create an output.txt file as a result.

If you wish to change the inputs, they must follow the format:
	1. Individual problem instances must be seperated by an empty line.
	2. Each person's schedule is typed first then the working period in the next line before 	moving on.
	3. The schedule for each person is within their working period.
	4. The last line of the problem instance is the meeting duration
	5. Lists must be syntactically correct in Python to be read.
